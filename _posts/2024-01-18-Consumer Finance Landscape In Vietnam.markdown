## This is a post about the "I hate even numbers" problem.

We're going to learn about it by solving coding test problems, reflecting on the problems we solved, and exploring other ways to solve them.

Let's start with the problem.

<!-- outline-end -->

Although Vietnam has grown from one of the poorest countries to a comfortably middle-income
one, it is sad to admit that both the average income and GDP per capita still lower than Thailand
and Malaysia<sup>(1)</sup> despite having enormous potential for natural resource with a massive workforce
in a variety of sectors and even many patents in terms of innovations. What makes me concern the
most is life quality of lower income class as the inequality in income distribution in Vietnam has
been enormously increased especially between the poorest and the richest groups. Income gap
between the two groups is 8 times<sup>(2)</sup> and the Gini index<sup>(*)</sup> is also higher than Thailand<sup>(3)</sup> while they
have higher GPD per capita than ours. More importantly, due to such social challenges in
respective of increase in inflation rate, unemployment, costly healthcare service etc., consumer
finance appears to be the most significant approaches for people to relieve from heavy financial
burden especially during worldwide outbreak of Covid pandemic, whereas access to credit services
from the banking system has many barriers leading to the development of usury. This type of
lending is a potential threat to public due to its exorbitant high interest rate and ability to force
borrowers sell their assets with mafia involvement which is a one of the most serious concerns of
government, however it does still exist thanks to its convenience and fast penetration. My ultimate
goal is definitely to find solutions to support people approach official financing channel.
With aforementioned adverse effects of usury, it is undeniable the critical role of consumer lending
by the virtue of offering not only instant loan without complicated procedure of banks but also
financial solution ecosystem including convenient payment method – credit card with easy
requirements, fast loan conversion from billing in order to facilitate every single aspect in life.
With my 4 years of experience in various functions, I continuously observed and analyzed a list of
pain points – 4 main challenges, that currently non-mortgage consumer lending is facing. To begin
with, although consumer credit in Vietnam has not been at an early stage anymore as it has
developed more than 15 years, admittedly, lack of focus and clear guidance from government
also makes consumer finance grow at a very moderate rate. The proportion of consumer finance
out of debt balance (excluded real estate loan) is only 8.7% much lower than other developing
countries like Malaysia and Indonesia which is 14.8% and 22.7% respectively<sup>(4)</sup>. In addition, due
to lack of standardized national individual information center as other developed nations like
US, the personal information consolidation, verification of customer in Vietnam facing a variety
of difficulties leading to limit of data mining for exploring new dimensions led to confusion and
fraudulent use of loopholes.
What’s more, the shortage of technology-oriented solutions such as data mining, big data
applications make process of consumer finance involve many manual operations and intuitive
decision instead of data-driven decision. This deficiency of current underwriting process which
utilize rule-base decision making, not capture well-rounded customer’s information, possibly
leading to the worst scenario while the organization may reject potential customers and grant loan
to fraudsters. It goes without saying that fraudulent of data privacy is one of the most serious
concerns as these valuable data assets having almost personal information of individuals. I myself
experienced an incident of all profiles of customers in our eligible base including personal
information, picture and credit behavior have been leaked, internal sales forces tried to replicate
same profiles and get loan easily with automation process for existing customers. Looking at the
bigger picture, even higher segment in banks were affected and suffered worse impact.
Vietcombank and Techcombank also suffered media crisis once their customers were suddenly
scammed out of $23,800 by hackers with sophisticated acts of hacking sims to illegally get OTP<sup>(5)</sup>.

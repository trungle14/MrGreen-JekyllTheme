### Advanced Analytics and Insights
*BigQuery for Data Warehousing:*
BigQuery, GCP's fully-managed, serverless data warehouse, allows for fast SQL queries and interactive analysis of massive datasets. It integrates with various data streaming sources for real-time analytics.

*Dataflow for Stream & Batch Data Processing:*
Dataflow is a managed service for processing data in both stream (real-time) and batch (historical) modes. It's ideal for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks and integrates seamlessly with BigQuery.

*AI Platform for Machine Learning:*
GCP's AI Platform provides tools for machine learning developers and data scientists. It offers services from building ML models to training and deploying them at scale, enabling predictive analytics and advanced insights.

*Looker for Business Intelligence:* Looker, part of the Google Cloud family, is a business intelligence software and big data analytics platform. It helps visualize and explore data, create actionable insights, and integrate data into daily workflows.

### Private global premium tier network

Google Cloud's Premium Tier leverages Google's extensive private global fiber network. 
This network is designed to provide low latency and high reliability for data transfer. 
The emphasis on private fiber is a distinctive feature of Google's approach. 
While AWS does use a mix of leased and owned infrastructure for its global network, may affect the network performance if it is not well-distributed among customers.

*TPU - Specialized Hardware Accelerators*
GCP offers access to advanced hardware accelerators like Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and high-performance GPUs. especially those built with TensorFlow - Significant advantage of building models on GCP. While other cloud services AWS does not have it.

*Analyzing Sales Trends and Patterns:*
By visualizing sales data over time, businesses can identify trends and patterns. This can help in forecasting demand, understanding seasonal fluctuations, and planning inventory accordingly.
*Dashboard Creation for Inventory Tracking:*
Looker Studio can be used to create interactive dashboards that display key inventory metrics such as stock levels, sales velocity, turnover rates, and backorder levels. These dashboards provide a quick visual reference to understand current inventory status.

With all aforementioned advantages of GCP in E-Commerce Inventory Management our team would like create the project in order to put it in the next level with the desirable outcome is end-to-end pipeline for sales forecasting and real-time prediction integrated inventory management by BigQuery and Vertex AI in interactive dashboard on Looker Studio.\
The project in high level is [here]('https://trungle14.github.io/tabs/projects.html')\

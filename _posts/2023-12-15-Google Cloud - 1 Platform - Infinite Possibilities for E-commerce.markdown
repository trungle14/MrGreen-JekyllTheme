 ***In the context of e-commerce, businesses are often dealing with a complex and dynamic environment characterized by: High Volume of Transactions; Extensive Product Catalogs, Diverse Customer Base; Data-Driven Decision Making; Need for Personalization; Global Reach and Scalability; Supply Chain and Logistics Management.***

*The DiD approach is typically utilized for evaluating the effects of large-scale policy changes or interventions. Examples include examining the influence of immigration policies on unemployment rates, the impact of changes in firearm laws on crime statistics, or evaluating how a marketing campaign affects user engagement. In these situations, there's always a timeframe before the intervention and one following it, where the goal is to discern the specific effects of the intervention from the overarching trend.*

### Private global premium tier network

Google Cloud's Premium Tier leverages Google's extensive private global fiber network. 
This network is designed to provide low latency and high reliability for data transfer. 
The emphasis on private fiber is a distinctive feature of Google's approach. 
While AWS does use a mix of leased and owned infrastructure for its global network, may affect the network performance if it is not well-distributed among customers.

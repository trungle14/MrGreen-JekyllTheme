# Abstract: The project introduces a comprehensive solution for enhancing inventory management in the e-commerce domain. Leveraging the robust capabilities of Google Cloud Platform, our system integrates Big Data and Machine Learning to optimize inventory levels. The core of our analytics pipeline resides in Google BigQuery, where data summarization and analysis take place, providing dynamic insights into inventory availability and accurate demand forecasting. The culmination of our efforts is a user-friendly dashboard developed on Google's Looker Studio. This platform empowers end-users and clients to intuitively visualize product inventory counts and forecasts, facilitating informed decision-making and efficient inventory control.

# Dataset 

The [eCommerce dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/thelook-ecommerce?project=galvanic-portal-404814) contains information about customers, products, orders, logistics, web events and digital marketing campaigns. The contents of this dataset are synthetic, and are provided to industry practitioners for the purpose of product discovery, testing, and evaluation.

        Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
